# Readme.MD File.
It was very complicated to get this going for me.
I am new on Github and found myself lost in so many resources that had too much information and not what i was looking for.

I found this great resource.
www.readme.so
It was a life saver to be able to created this Markdown file for my repository.

I am confused still with the vast amount of information in Github but I am confident that with time I would be able to get more fluid in the resources and collaborations here.

The important part is that your own commitment to learn and be part of a community.
